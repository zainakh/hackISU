Checkout Nutrition is a Chrome extension that can be called upon when the user is on the webpage for their HyVee cart. The extension lists the products in the cart, the calories of each product in the cart, the main macro nutrients in the products, and a total of the above parameters at the end.
We utilized Javascript to scrape the HTML data from the HyVee page which allowed us to grab the names of the products. We then used Cross-Origin XMLHttpRequests to get the data of the product from a search of the MyFitnessPal database without switching the web page (as the extension only works on the HyVee page). With all the data, all that was left was to format it into a Chrome extension and create a website to accompany. There was also a Python version of the script originally, but was abandoned despite its working status since embedding a Python script into the website was not particularly simple (going into AWS Lambdas looked to be the best bet, but none us had experience with AWS to begin with).
